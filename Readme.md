Auto_login_Ultra_Host is a script that will help you to login,register,and request server without opening your browser.

Feature:
- You can use bot auto login to keep your server turned on, you can also user syncronus mode to keep the app running to keep your server on and Ultra-h.com wont delete your server(good if you have VPS)
(Auto login Feature Needs to Run PC 24 Hours, to keep the script running)
- You can use bot auto request server, if you lost your server, you can request another one(depends on ultra-h.com server availibility)
- You can use auto register to register new account (Proxy Required)
For this time The whole script using "Bahasa Indonesia" as a primary language. For english language i'll make it soon

[WARNING]
If you want to login with many account you have to use many proxy (as many as account you have)
